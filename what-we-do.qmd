Teaching

</h1>

<p class="lead">

Some example text for what we can do to help

</p>

-   Taught workshops on species distribution modelling using MaxEnt, capture-recapture modelling using MARK, distance sampling with program Distance and Statistical Modelling in R and Genstat
-   Assisted with the teaching of under-graduate and Masters level statistics courses
