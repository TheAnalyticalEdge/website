# [How we can help you]{.smallcaps}

![](https://www.theanalyticaledge.com/images/slides/woodrat.jpg){alt=""} The Key Largo woodrat was used as a case study species for the development of trapping point transects

![](https://www.theanalyticaledge.com/images/slides/aircraft.jpg){alt=""} Joanne investigated the difference between different statistical estimation techniques for heavily censored data sets, using aircraft component failure as the motivating example
