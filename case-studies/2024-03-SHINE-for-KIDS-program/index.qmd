[Synopsis:]{.underline} Russell Thomson analysed sample survey data across multiple time points for a contract with Western Sydney University.

[More Details:]{.underline} To evaluate a program’s effectiveness for researchers in the School of Education at Western Sydney University, we analysed likert scale style data collected before and after the program using a mixed effects regression model.

[Quote from Katrina Barker, WSU:]{.underline} “Russell has been incredibly responsive and collaborative. He dedicated time to thoroughly understand our project needs, offering a sophisticated approach to analysing the data that suited our project’s objectives and met our delivery timelines”.
