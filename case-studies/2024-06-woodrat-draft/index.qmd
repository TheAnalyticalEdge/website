> Throughout 2024, Dr. Russell Thomson provided statistical consulting expertise for A/Prof Costan Magnussen and his team at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute. Costan’s research questions are around understanding the early life determinants of adult cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. He often employs the Young Finns cohort dataset to answer these questions. Russell’s consulting made a difference in publishing in (Nature) \[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07993-x\], when he provided statistical insights, such as a method to implement multiple imputation and obtain relative risks with a Bayesian model.
