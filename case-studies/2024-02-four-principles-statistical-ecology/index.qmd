At the [International Statistical Ecology Conference](https://isec2020.multiscreensite.com/#:~:text=June%2022%2D26%2C%202020%208,%2D11am%20%26%209pm%2D12am%20GMT&text=There%20were%20two%20conference%20sessions,thousand%20messages%20in%20public%20channels) in 2020, there was a round table discussion on developing some guiding principals for ecologists to improve experimental design and to ensure their reporting is transparent and repeatable.

This was a large collaborative project led by [Dr Gordana Popovic](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-gordana-popovic), involving 18 lead authors from five continents. The Abstract was translated in to four languages other than English - testimony to the diversity of the authorship. Twenty-eight other researchers participated in the round table discussions providing valuable insights in to their experience and feedback in to their experience working in the statistical ecology space.

We agreed upon four guiding principles. They were:

1.  define a focused research question, then plan sampling and analysis to answer it;

2.  develop a model that accounts for the distribution and dependence of your data;

3.  emphasise effect sizes to replace statistical significance with ecological relevance; and

4.  report your methods and findings in sufficient detail so that your research is valid and reproducible.
