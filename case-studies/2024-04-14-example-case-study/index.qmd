Here's some example text for this case study

This is a quarto document, so you can include any normal R (or Python, or Julia, or more!) code in here.

Equations are supported

$$
Pr(\theta|y) = \frac{Pr(y|\theta)Pr(\theta)}{\Pr(y)}
$$

Here's some code.

```{r}
#| label: terra-rast-vec
library(terra)
raster_file <- system.file("ex/elev.tif", package = "terra") |> rast()
raster_file

vector_file <- system.file("ex/lux.shp", package = "terra") |> vect()
vector_file

```

```{r}
#| label: terra-plot-lines
plot(raster_file)
lines(vector_file)

```

```{r}
#| label: libs
library(brolgar)
library(naniar)
library(visdat)
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
#| label: visdat-naniar
vis_miss(airquality)
gg_miss_var(airquality)
gg_miss_upset(airquality)

```

```{r}
#| label: plot-heights
ggplot(heights,
       aes(x = year,
           y = height_cm,
           group = country)) + 
    geom_line()

ggplot(heights,
       aes(x = year,
           y = height_cm,
           group = country)) + 
    geom_line() +
    facet_strata(along = -height_cm)
```
