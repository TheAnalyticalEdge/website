# About Us
:::

::: g-col-8
::: nice
We are a network of statisticians, ecologists, and biosecurity experts, whose work supports diverse stakeholders such as academia, government and the private sector, to achieve their goals.

Our services include:

-   Use of risk-based investigative tools for assessing the consequences of management actions

-   Designing surveillance protocols to eradicate diseases within agricultural settings

-   Survey design to estimate animal and plant abundance

-   Analysis of data collected via active underwater acoustics to analyse migration patterns

-   Survey design and data analysis for population modelling, including species spread and population growth in landscapes

-   Application of sophisticated data analysis techniques to publish research in high impact, peer-reviewed journals

-   Delivery of technical workshops on statistical topics

For some examples of our work, see our [case studies](case-studies.html)
