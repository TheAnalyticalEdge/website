Mike Cove is an applied conservation ecologist and mammalogist, with a strong quantitative background, having completed his PhD studies at NCSU utilising occupancy modelling and spatial capture-recapture techniques to study small mammals.

His research uses traditional methods and museum collections, as well as non-invasive survey techniques and statistical modelling procedures, to study population and community ecology.

Mike's research interests are mainly focused on the conservation of mammal communities, but also mesopredator release and trophic cascades, the urban/suburban wildlife interface, species invasions, disease ecology and animal microbiomes, and human dimensions of conservation and sustainable development in the tropics.
