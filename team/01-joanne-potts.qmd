## Company Director, Consultant Statistician

Joanne is the Director of The Analytical Edge Statistical Consulting. She has worked in Australia, the United Kingdom and the USA in both academic and government settings as a statistical consultant.

After completing her undergraduate degree at The [University of Melbourne in Applied Statistics](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/) and [Environmental Science](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438000600247X), she worked as a consultant statistician at the [Arthur Rylah Institute for Ecological Research](http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/arthur-rylah-institute) within the Victorian State Government. Here, she completed research in a variety of ecological applications, such as assessing the [impact of salinization](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01672.x/abstract), and [habitat fragmentation](http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/144/display/citation/paper/WR07010.htm).

In 2006, Joanne left the Victorian state government and moved to the [Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling](http://creem2.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at University of St Andrews in Scotland, to undertake her PhD studies. She was supervised by [Prof. Stephen Buckland](http://www.creem.st-and.ac.uk/stb/index.html), [Dr. Len Thomas](http://www.creem.st-and.ac.uk/len/), and Dr Anne Savage, and developed methods for incorporating animal movement data into capture-recapture analysis for [abundance estimation for small mammals](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00205.x/abstract).

Her post-doctoral research was undertaken at the Centre for Environmental Sciences, the University of Southampton, England. Her project, titled “Understanding the status, autecology and taxonomy of UK Biodiversity Action Plan Species”, was funded by [DEFRA](http://www.defra.gov.uk/ "Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"), UK.

More recently, Joanne’s work has focused on risk analysis within biosecurity and engineering settings, working as a Research Fellow at the [Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis](http://www.acera.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne. For example, she developed [risk-based trace priorities for disease outbreak](http://www.acera.unimelb.edu.au/materials/endorsed/1006B_OID2_Report.pdf) \[PDF\], funded by [DAFF](http://www.daff.gov.au/ "Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry"); and assessed statistical methods (namely, maximum likelihood estimation and median-rank regression) for dealing with heavily censored data, funded by [DSTO](http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/ "Defence Science and Technology Organisation").
