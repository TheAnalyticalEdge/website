## Company Director, Consultant Statistician

Joanne is an Accredited Statistician with the Statistical Society of Australia and the Director of The Analytical Edge Statistical Consulting. Since 2012, Joanne has run her own statistical consulting firm, The Analytical Edge Pty. Ltd., based in southern Tasmania. During this time, she has successfully delivered numerous nationally and internationally funded projects to several state and federal government agencies, NGOs, private industry and academic researchers, advising on survey design and analysing data with a diverse area of application. Projects have included conducting impact assessments; estimating abundance and distribution of invasive, rare and commercially harvested species including [fallow deer](https://www.publish.csiro.au/WR/WR13206), [Patagonian toothfish](https://hal.science/hal-03331843/) and abalone; developing [species distribution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aec.13221) and population demographic models, and developing models of pest and disease spread to assess biosecurity risk in [agricultural settings](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12065).

After completing her undergraduate degree at The University of Melbourne in Applied Statistics and Environmental Science, she worked as a consultant statistician at the [Arthur Rylah Institute for Ecological Research](https://www.ari.vic.gov.au) within the Victorian State Government. Here, she completed research in a variety of ecological applications, such as assessing the [impact of salinization](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01672.x/abstract), and [habitat fragmentation](http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/144/display/citation/paper/WR07010.htm).

In 2006, Joanne left the Victorian state government and moved to the [Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling](http://creem2.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at University of St Andrews in Scotland, to undertake her PhD studies. She was supervised by Prof. Stephen Buckland, Dr. Len Thomas and Dr Anne Savage, and developed methods for incorporating animal movement data into capture-recapture analysis for [abundance estimation for small mammals](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00205.x/abstract) and [compared abundance estimation techniques](https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wsb.651).
