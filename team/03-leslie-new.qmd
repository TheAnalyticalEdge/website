Dr. Leslie New graduated from Cornell University (BS in Natural Resources, 2003) and the University of St Andrews (PhD in Statistics and Biology, 2010). She remained at St Andrews as a postdoctoral fellow, before continuing her research with the US Marine Mammal Commission and the US Geological Survey at [Patuxent Wildlife Research Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/patuxent-wildlife-research-center/science). She was tenured in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and Washington State University, Vancouver, before moving to her current post as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics at [Ursinus College](https://www.ursinus.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science-and-statistics/). 

Her research focuses on statistical ecology, including the practical application of hierarchical Bayesian state-space models, understanding and mitigating human-wildlife conflict, and quantitatively assessing the population consequences of disturbance. Dr. New is particularly interested in the quantification, incorporation and propagation of uncertainty in statistical models used for management and conservation decisions and how to incorporate Star Wars into teaching and research.
